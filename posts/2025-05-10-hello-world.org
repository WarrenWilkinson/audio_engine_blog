Hello World! (classic!)

I'm starting a blog to go along with my personal project: To build a
controller-ist instrument using...

  * A raspberry PI 4
  * A Wii Rockband Guitar
  * A computer keyboard
  * A track mouse
  * SuperCollider
  * And some DACs, some wire and a whole lotta prayers.

Here's a picture of what I'm envisioning.

Isn't it *awful* (or /beautiful/ depending on your mindset)?!?.  Let me tell you
about some of the features I hope to put into this Frankenstein:

  - That number pad where you strum is supposed to be under the wires.
    It's for percussive guitar so when you wham the bottom or top row
    I can trigger a drum-kit sound.  This is for fast (but simple) drum fills.
  - The RockBand keyboard hanging off the bottom is for playing keyboard /
    synth parts. It's a midi device.
  - The computer keyboard hanging off the side is for controlling
    other things
    - what synths are loaded
    - creating and playing back loops
    - typing in "patterns" to control a drum machine or rhythm
      generator
    - set bpm, time signature, song (for lyrics on output video).
  - The trackball mouse at the top I'm hoping can give me DJ
    scratching, or other misc effects.
  - The guitar isn't supposed to be an off the shelf guitar.
    - Frame out of two-by-fours, components set into it.
    - ideally, I build my own humbuckers into a set of IC DACs so that I can read
      each wire independently.
      - Hoping to enable a "midi" mode where the guitar is another midi instrument.
      - Hoping to enable a "chord pattern" system (since the instrument knows song key,
	perhaps it can pitch shift each string appropriately to emulate a specific
	chord without me having to do it -- cause I'm busy).

So with introductions out of the way. I should mention that I've never
used SuperCollider before.  I do have like 20 years experience with
programming and Linux, but less experience with hardware, and none
with Synthesizer design.  I've done a little guitar and piano, meaning
I know what notes and chords and key signatures are, but I can't play
any songs.

So to achieve my goal of being able to play decent renditions of some
of my favourite songs (western rock, pop, rap, etc; details irrelevant)
I need to make progress on several tranches.

 * Building the right sounds in SuperCollider
 * Building the instrument
 * Determining how the instrument will actually work (by this I mean, what will the buttons actually do - not how the code will work)
 * learning and practising many songs.

To that end, I'm writing this blog.  A construction diary, so that
others can follow and modify to their own tastes.  That is all, for
now.
