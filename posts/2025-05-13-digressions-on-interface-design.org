I wonder about how to "fit" the many genre unique sounds into
something playable.  For example, metal music has a certain sound to
it's vocals, drums, guitar, piano and auxilary instruments. So does
rock, country pop, techo, classical and video game music.

One approach is an artificial division into separate spaces. For
example, this heirarchical approach:

* Idea 1: Genre based heirarchy

This approach is easy to understand and devise an interface for. I'd
probably assign letters or numbers to the different paths so that
every leaf gets a unique code that could be typed in quickly. The
downside is low flexibility. No blending, no improvization in this
domain.  Just pick the set of prepackaged sounds and go.

Of course, you can make it *more* flexible by doing something like
this for each instrument.  Then you could combine metal drums with pop
synths. Which leads to another strategy (which is also a seperate spaces
stategy, but a little less artificial):

* Idea 2: Bank Assignment

#+begin_src ditaa :file media/2025-05-13-Digressions-on-Interface-Design/seperate-instruments.png :exports results

   Banks           +-----+      Sounds
  +-------------+  |     |   +--------------------+
  | 1           +--|--+  +-->| Heavy Fuzz Guitar  |
  +-------------+  |  |      +--------------------+
  | 2           +--+  +----->| Drum Kit A         |
  +-------------+            +--------------------+
  | ...         |            | ...                |
  +-------------+            +--------------------+
  | N           +----------->| Reverb Voice       |
  +-------------+            +--------------------+

#+end_src

In this model, "banks" are assigned sounds. What are banks?  Well if I
have a midi keyboard I might assign half of it Keyboard A and half of
it Bass Guitar B, and if I hit a certain midi switch maybe it all
becomes Drumkit Z.  So the keyboard is represented by 3 banks (Low
half, high half, switched mode).  Splitting instruments into banks is
some decision made a head of time..

The benefits of this arrangement is that I have more performance-time
flexibility in how things should sound.  The drawback is the time it
would take to assign a sound to each bank.

Of course you could combine this idea with the prior one, and then you
have some kind of mass-assignment code that gets you into the right
groove, followed by fine tuning.  The downside is that now you've got
to memorize two systems.

* Idea 3: An N-dimensional space

Another possible approach would be to take the genre-splitting idea and map the
leaves onto a 2D grid like this

#+begin_src ditaa :file media/2025-05-13-Digressions-on-Interface-Design/grid-of-genres.png :exports results
  +-------+     
  | Cntry |     +-----+                             +-----+
  |   1   |     | ROCK|                             | Tech|
  |cYEL   |     |  1  |                             |  1  |
  +-------+     | cRED|  +-----+                    | cBLU|
		+-----+  | ROCK|                    +-----+
	       +------+  |  3  |  +-----+          +-----+ 
	       | Cntry|  |cRED |  | ROCK|          | Pop | 
	       |   2  |  +-----+  |  2  |          |  1  | 
	       |cYEL  |           | cRED|          | cPNK| 
    dim1       +------+           +-----+          +-----+ 
     ^                                 +-----+            
     :                                 | Pop |
     |                                 | 2   |
     |                                 | cPNK|
     +--------> dim2                   +-----+

The idea here is that you define some transformation F and use it to
put all the genre leaf nodes into a 2D space.  Then you can change
your position in this space with a mouse.  But then you need to exit
the space and get back to a sound set... that could be done with
nearest neighbor, but ideally some kind of interpolation.

This has a number of conceptual problems

 1. What is the transformation?
 2. What do dim1 and dim2 represent?
 3. How do you interpolate between the sounds?
 4. Can such an interpolation be implemented?

Before tackling these, I'd just like to note that you could have more
than 2 dimensions.  You could do 2, then click, then 2 more (Or have
two trackballs).

For point 4 --- this depends on how your sounds are arranged and
organized.  For example if every soundset is the same except for
linear numeric tuning parameters, it's clearly possible, and the
interpolation function is easily defined.

For point 3, if you did this 2D grid for every "instrument sound",
then maybe nearest neighbor for each instrument would give a neat sort
of interpolation on the overall sound.  For example maybe in
transitioning from Country1 to Rock1, first the cowbell is replaced by
a clap sound, then the twangy guitar becomes acoustic, and then the
piano becomes more synthetic.

For point 2 -- who knows?  Ideally you find something that makes it
understandable from a human point of view.  This is unlikely for
"whole instrument sets".  You might be able to find such a pair for
individual instruments though, and that might be a fun way to tweak
it.  For example, maybe in the case of guitar sounds you end up with
one dimension kind of being like distortion and the other being kind
of like flange or reverb.

** Conclusions?

Nothing much to conclude.  You can't really know what you need until
you start building and using stuff.
